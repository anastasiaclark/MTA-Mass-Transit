<description>This point layer represents MTA New York City Transit local bus stops. Each point represents an individual location where one or more buses make stops along one or more bus routes. The unique ID for the features is stop_id, a field created by the MTA. The geoid field indicates which county the stop is located in using the state-county ANSI FIPS code. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts. Please note: data in this May 2020 edition represents reduced, essential service due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
