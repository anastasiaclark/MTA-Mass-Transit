<description>This line layer represents subway routes for the New York City Subway and the Staten Island Railway, managed by MTA New York City Transit. Each line represents an individual subway route along physical track locations during normal, weekday rush hour service, matching the conventions used on the MTA's official subway maps. In some instances, the data from the original source was modified or adjusted to make corrections. The unique_id for the features is route_id, a field created by the MTA that uses the familiar letter or number designation for trains, with distinct IDs for each of the shuttle (S) trains. The color field includes the official color hex code that's used for symbolizing the routes on maps. This layer was created by the GIS Lab at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layer series, to provide access to mass transit features for basic geographic analysis and map making. The data was generated from the MTA's static data developer feeds. It was transformed and generalized from a GTFS format into readily usable GIS features using a series of python scripts. Please note: data in this May 2020 edition represents reduced, essential service due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
